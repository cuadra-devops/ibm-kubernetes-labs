# IBM Kubernetes, Docker, and OpenShift Certifcation Labs 

This repository contains links to the IBM Skills Network labs I am currently working on as part of my learning journey in Kubernetes, Docker, and OpenShift. Below are the links to each lab that I am practicing:

## Completed Labs

### 1. [Lab:Introduction to Containers, Docker, and IBM Cloud Container Registry] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift/ungradedLti/kgtxc/lab-introduction-to-containers-docker-and-ibm-cloud-container-registry)

In this lab, I did the following: Pull an image from Docker Hub, Run an image as a container using docker, Build an image using a Dockerfile, and Push an image to IBM Cloud Container Registry.
### 2. [Lab:Practice Lab: Introduction to Kubernetes Objects] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift/ungradedLti/CFJWM/practice-lab-introduction-to-kubernetes-objects)  

In this lab I did the following: Create a Kubernetes Service, Use various kubectl commands, Deploy a StatefulSet for managing stateful applications, Implement a DaemonSet for running a single pod on all nodes.

### 3. [Lab: Scaling and Updating Applications] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift/ungradedLti/SMHuo/hands-on-lab-scaling-and-updating-applications)
In this lab I did the following:Scale an application with a ReplicaSet, Apply rolling updates to an application, Use a ConfigMap to store application configuration, andAutoscale the application using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

### 4. [Lab: Introduction to RedHat OpenShift] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift/ungradedLti/Hz976/lab-introduction-to-openshift)  
In this lab I did the following: Use the oc CLI (OpenShift command line interface), Use the OpenShift web console, Build and deploy an application using s2i ('Source-to-image' build strategy), Inspect a BuildConfig and an ImageStream, and Autoscale the application.
### 5. [Practice Project - Understanding ConfigMaps, DaemonSets, Kubernetes Services, Secrets & Persistent Volume Claims] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift/ungradedLti/CiM7w/practice-project-understanding-configmaps-daemonsets-kubernetes-services-secrets)  
In this practice project I did the following: ConfigMap, DaemonSet, Kubernetes Service, Secret, andVolumes and Persistent Volume Claims.
1.how to set up a ConfigMap to manage configuration data for the myapp application.
2.create a DaemonSet to ensure that a pod runs on each node in the cluster, including the nodes where the 'myapp' pods are deployed.
3.create a Kubernetes Service to expose your application within the cluster.
4.create and manage secrets in Kubernetes to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, and SSH keys.
5. how to define volumes and persistent volume claims (PVCs) in Kubernetes to provide storage for your application.
## Summary

This repository will continue to be updated as I complete more labs and challenges in the IBM Kubernetes and Cloud course. Stay tuned!
