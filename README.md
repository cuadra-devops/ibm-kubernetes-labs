# IBM Kubernetes, Docker, and OpenShift Certifcation Labs 

This repository contains links to the IBM Skills Network labs I am currently working on as part of my learning journey in Kubernetes, Docker, and OpenShift. Below are the links to each lab that I am practicing:

## Completed Labs

### 1. [Lab:Introduction to Containers, Docker, and IBM Cloud Container Registry] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift/ungradedLti/kgtxc/lab-introduction-to-containers-docker-and-ibm-cloud-container-registry)

In this lab, we did the following: Pull an image from Docker Hub, Run an image as a container using docker, Build an image using a Dockerfile, and Push an image to IBM Cloud Container Registry.
### 2. [Lab:Practice Lab: Introduction to Kubernetes Objects] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift/ungradedLti/CFJWM/practice-lab-introduction-to-kubernetes-objects)  

In this lab I did the following: Create a Kubernetes Service, Use various kubectl commands, Deploy a StatefulSet for managing stateful applications, Implement a DaemonSet for running a single pod on all nodes.

### 3. [Lab: Scaling and Updating Applications] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift/ungradedLti/SMHuo/hands-on-lab-scaling-and-updating-applications)
In this lab I did the following:Scale an application with a ReplicaSet, Apply rolling updates to an application, Use a ConfigMap to store application configuration, andAutoscale the application using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

### 4. [Lab: Introduction to RedHat OpenShift] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift/ungradedLti/Hz976/lab-introduction-to-openshift)  
In this lab I did the following: Use the oc CLI (OpenShift command line interface), Use the OpenShift web console, Build and deploy an application using s2i ('Source-to-image' build strategy), Inspect a BuildConfig and an ImageStream, and Autoscale the application.
### 5. [Lab: Creating Docker Containers](https://www.ibm.com/training/course/bbbb)  
Learn how to create and deploy Docker containers for Kubernetes and OpenShift environments.

## Summary

This repository will continue to be updated as I complete more labs and challenges in the IBM Kubernetes and Cloud course. Stay tuned!
